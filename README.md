# UNChat

## Chatbot for the National University of Colombia

This project presents a chatbot based on **LLM Engineering**, focused on helping the active community of the **National University of Colombia** resolve their doubts regarding academic, bureaucratic, and administrative matters.

### 🚀 Motivation
The main motivation for this project lies in the lack of centralized information within the university and the difficulty of accessing it. Under normal circumstances, students must visit at least **two different offices** before obtaining the information they need.

For this reason, **UNChat** was created—a platform where users can effectively access processed information for easier understanding.

### 🔍 Technology
This system relies on **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** on a database of documents containing regulatory and legal information. This enables the **LLM** to provide enriched and accurate responses.

### 🛠 Tools Used
The development of the chatbot utilizes the following technologies:
- **Selenium**
- **BeautifulSoup**
- **OpenAI API**
- **LangChain**
- **Chroma**
- And additional tools
